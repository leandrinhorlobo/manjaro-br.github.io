title: manjaro.org homepage redesigned
---

Our Web-Development-Team leaded by Roland Singer is currently working on our new Manjaro homepage. With this change we also do a server upgrade. Thanks flies out to our community for financing it with your donations.

Followed changes will happen:

* complete redesign based on our own framework software
* built-in bug tracker with easy management
* built-in development project management
* built-in blog with easy management
* multilanguage support

Each web-service will be a module. This way we can easly backup/restore damaged goods. This makes it also harder to get hacked. Additionally we plan to extend our web-services to boxit-web, manjaro-tools-web (incl. webbased custom ISO-build service).

So stay tuned for what will come in 2015!
